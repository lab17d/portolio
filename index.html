				<p>Hello, my name is Lily Bodolay and welcome to my website. If you have found yourself on this website, you probably want to know a little bit more about me.</p>

				<p>I am currently a senior at Florida State University, graduating in May 2021. I chose to major in Information, Communication, and Technology and minor in Computer Science. I know this is the degree for me. Ever since I was a little kid, I have been passionate about computers and the ever changing tech world. Growing up, my mother would call me her little techie. I hope to use that passion to land myself job in the UX world.</p>

					<h1>JH Creative </h1><h2>Jr. Creative Assistant | May 2020- Present | Remote</h2>
					<p>JH Creative is a design studio located in Tallahassee, Florida. I initially got the opportunity to intern the summer of 2020 prior to COVID-19. Due to the pandemic, myself, and the team worked completely remotely. My time interning went so well that I was offered a part time position for the fall semester.</p>
					<p>During my time there I got to learn many technical skills:</p>
					<ul>
						
						<li>Collaborated and designed <a href="https://jhc-2021.webflow.io/" target="_blank">company website </a> utilizing both <a href="assets/jhc-wireframe.png" target="_blank">InVision for wireframing</a> and Webflow for developing.</li>
						<li>Developed a <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/Ztl1dQpL7iCCE/" target="_blank">landing page</a> using Adobe Spark.</li>
						<li>Lead video production from conceptual stage to execution.</li>
						<li>Produced 5+ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CGAyaadFAeB/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">highlight reels </a>for IGTV from screen-captured livestreams.</li>

					<h1>Publix Supermarkets </h1><h2>Cashier | March 2015- Present | #782</h2>
					<p>I began working for Publix at the age of 15 starting as a Front Service Clerk. After 10 months, I began training to become a cashier. I was able to hold this job throughout high school and college by transferring from my hometown in Orlando, to my collegetown, Tallahassee. While classes were in session, I would work on average 15 hours weekly.</p>

					<p>Working at Publix I had many responsibilities:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provided premiere customer service while managing 100+ transactions per day.</li>
						<li>Managed a range of $500 - $1,000+ in the cash drawer at a given time.</li>
						<li>Implemented associate and customer safety by adhering to Publix Associate safety guidelines.</li>

						<h1>COM 4470: Desktop Multimedia</h1><h2>Fall 2019</h2>
						
						<p>In this course, I had to pose as a marketing company and pretend an existing company hired me. The technical purpose of this class was to introduce the Adobe Creative Suite: PhotoShop, inDesign, and Dreamweaver.</p>
						
						<p>Throughout the course we were challenged to:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Articulate a comprehensive project proposal completed with brief outlines of both projects.</li>
							<li>Draft a <a href="assets/print.pdf" target="_blank">print based campagin</a> using Adobe InDesign and PhotoShop.</li>

					<h1>LIS 4351: User Experience Design</h1><h2>Fall 2020</h2>
					
					<p>This course is an overview of the user experience design process. It is comprised of group design sprints in which the professor decided on an interface that the students have the challenge to redesign. At given times in the course, students also were given timed intervals on the spot to design or redesign objects based off of the lecture of the day.</p>
					
					<h2>Design Sprint 2</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The second design sprint students were tasked to redesign the <a href="images/old.png" target="_blank">Crestron Interface</a>. This is the system used with in classrooms on campus to control the projector.</li>
						<li>My group came up with both <a href="assets/mockup.png" target="_blank">mockups</a> created on InVision and a <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAELGbZVgvc/kPomXtszgjac2eKbCxF4aQ/view?utm_content=DAELGbZVgvc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton" target="_blank"> final design</a> built on Canva.</li>
						<li>The design has a few assumptions. The first being, this is a touch screen as the original. We decided to update it to feel more like an app on a mobile device with the different tabs on the bottom and the date and time on top. Another assumption we collaborated on was that the distinction on the lights.</li>

I am incorporating ideas I learned in my classes and compiling them all into this website. I also took time to further my knowledge of web development, by reading on the Bootstrap website and watching YouTube tutorials.</p>

				<p>I was able to create a <a href="assets/wireframeLilyBodolay.png" target="_blank"> wireframe</a> with Invision. I curated both the cover and section header graphics on Canva. Another big resource I used was Giphy to make all of the gifs found throughout this site. When it came to the programming, I took to w3Schools for tutorials and Bootstrap 4 for documentation. Finally, to upload this project I used github to publish.</p>

Lily is bright and vivacious.  Her outgoing personality leaves people wanting to get to know her.  She is a leader among her peers and an asset to any team. I believe Lily’s talents and abilities will take her far in this life."</p>

					  	<p>"As a child, I instilled in Lily the value of taking pride in one's hard work while at the same time paying attention to the details. As an adult, I think Lily has mastered this skill with ease and gracefulness. </p>
						<p>As a kid, she took a keen interest in learning and understanding technology. By age 8, she was already reprogramming my cellular phone without any prompting. Knowing how technologically impaired I am and having witnessed my own "computer meltdowns", she has morphed herself into becoming the family techie and our go-to girl. </p>
						<p>Lily is passionate about technology and innovations. She would make a wonderful and addition who would quickly become an invaluable asset to any tech company or social media outlet that is willing to take that chance on my <bold> NOLE</bold> girl as she is both motivated and very tenacious."</p>
