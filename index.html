				<p>Hello. My name is Lily Bodolay and welcome to my website. If you have found yourself here, you will probably want to learn a little bit more about me. I am currently a senior at Florida State University, graduating in April 2021.</p>

				<p>I chose to major in Information, Communication, and Technology and minor in Computer Science. I know this is the degree for me. Ever since I was a little kid, I have been passionate about computers and the ever-changing tech world. Growing up, my mother would call me her “little techie”. I hope to use this passion to land myself a job in the User Experience world.</p>

					<h1>LIS 4351: User Experience Design</h1><h2>Fall 2020</h2>
					
					<p>This course is an overview of the user experience design process. It is comprised of group design sprints where the professor choses an interface that students are challenged to redesign. Periodically during the course, students were surprised with unannounced timed intervals to design or modify objects based on the lecture taught that day.</p>
					
					<h2>Design Sprint 2</h2>
					<h3><a href="assets/design-sprint2-case-study.pdf" target="_blank">Case Study</a></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The second design sprint students were tasked to redesign the <a href="images/old.png" target="_blank">Crestron Interface</a>. This is a system utilized by professors to control classroom projectors.</li>
						<li>My group came up with both <a href="assets/mockup.png" target="_blank">wireframe</a> concept utilizing InVision and a <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAELGbZVgvc/kPomXtszgjac2eKbCxF4aQ/view?utm_content=DAELGbZVgvc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton" target="_blank"> final design</a> built within Canva.</li>
						<li>Our design encompassed a touch screen in keeping with the original interface. My workgroup updated the design to resemble an app seen typically on mobile devices and gave the professor the ease of adjustable classroom lighting while being conducive with the projection screen/learning environment.</li>

				<p>I built this website for multiple reasons, most importantly to gain experience. What better subject matter that I have knowledge of, than myself! Yes, I have built websites before. I wanted to create something of value to showcase my skill set. I incorporated ideas I learned in class and compiled them all into this website. To further my knowledge of web development, I studied the Bootstrap website and watched various YouTube tutorials to come up with this final product.</p>

				<p>I created a <a href="assets/wireframeLilyBodolay.png" target="_blank"> wireframe</a> with Invision. I curated both the cover and section header graphics on Canva. As a resource, I used Giphy to make all the gifs found throughout this site. When it came to programming, I took to w3Schools for tutorials and Bootstrap 4 for documentation. Finally, to upload this finished project, I used Github to publish.</p>

Lily is bright and vivacious.  Her outgoing personality leaves people wanting to get to know her.  She is a leader among her peers and an asset to any team.

					  	<p>"As a child, I instilled in Lily the value of taking pride in one's hard work while at the same time paying attention to the details. As an adult, I think Lily has mastered this skill with ease and gracefulness.</p>
						<p>She took a keen interest in understanding technology. By age 8, she was already reprogramming my cellular phone without any prompting. She has morphed herself into becoming the "family techie" and is our go-to girl.</p>
						<p>Lily is passionate about technology and innovations. She will make a wonderful addition and will quickly become an invaluable asset to any tech company or social media outlet that is willing to take that chance on my <bold> NOLE</bold> girl as she is both motivated and very tenacious."</p>
